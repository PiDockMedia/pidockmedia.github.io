## Synology DS1621+ Setup Adventures

This is supposed to make my life easier.

- Things I need
	- Synology DS1621+
	- 32GB Memory (I went inexpensive 2x16GB V-COLOR)
		- Why? Docker and Maybe a VM or two.
	- Cache?
		- Yes, but only 1 NVMe ssd for Read
		- Going with Synology Brand as not too pricey and made for the intended use
	- Drives - Not my end state but:
		- 3x 4TB WD Red and 3x 10TB WD shucked Easystore
		- SHR
		- BTRFS - with all the protection doodads
		- No Encryption

- Honestly why did I not do a step by step here? Because it walks you through it and it was EASY!
