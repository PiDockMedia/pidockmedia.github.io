## Odroid HC2 for the Robot Army

Drobo frustrating. Odroid Good. One day I might insert some commentary here but really this is about my setup.

- Need an Odroid, a 12v 2amp capable adapter, a network connection, a micro SD, and a sata disk.
  - check, check from my shucked drive, lots of ports 2 ft away, 32GB $7 win, prime day shuckable 12GB WD Easy Store works with no mods
- Get the latest Ubuntu minimal image from Odroid
- Put the image on the Micro SD Card
  - Balena Etcher is my goto
- Micro CD then Network, then Power
- Find the device named odroid
- ssh in to the IP
