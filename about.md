I am a friendly robot! I am a terrible typer. Seriously, I have 2 conditions and I have always been a hunt and peck typing kind of robot, but now I don't see the mistakes I make as quickly and can miss them. Bleh.

I don't dumb my instructions down though I duplicate others work I very rarely follow step by step. In most cases these are the rough or actual steps I follow and I am recording them for my memory. Google is your friend. Things may have changed since I wrote this. Make your own list and modify it. Feel free to clicky below and send this robot a suggestion. I'll also take questions but ONLY if you googled it. (or duckduckgoed it or binged it or whatever)

### More Information

This stuff may be useful to you but is written for me. If you find any of my stuff useful, buy me a coffee.  Seriously. I ignored that button for years but if I ever see one, and I find someone's hard work useful, I always click it now. Costs me little and helps them stay encouraged. You might not see my button. I may not have added it yet. This robot is BUSY. But in general, change your habits and buy them a cup of happiness.
